This project includes the implementation of an ECG with BLE functionallity, which allows the communication and data tranfer to a connected receiving device.


Setup:

Download and install the newset version of the [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

Pull the code from this repository and open the file with the *.ino extension, the ArduinoIDE should open automatically after this.
Once opened you will promted to download libaries which are required by this project, download them.
Wait until all the libaries are downloaded.

To fulfill wanted requirements (in aspect to the data tranfer) some adjustments to the used ArduinoBLE-Libary had to be made.
The forked repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Stefan7400/ArduinoBLE).
Download the project as .zip, extract it, and replace the existing ArduinoBLE libary folder with the forked one.

Now you should be ready to go.
